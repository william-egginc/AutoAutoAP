# Virtue ascension chain search

Finds the fastest sequence of prestige checkpoints to reach a Truth Egg target.

You pick a chain like `195 219 248 286 327 490`: ascend to TE 195, prestige, ascend to
219, prestige, … finally reach 490. Different chains take 700–950 real-world days, and
the spread between a good and a bad one is about 12 days. This tool searches for a good
one by scoring candidates with the planner app's own simulator.

Good chains are genuinely rare. On the one account where every chain in a window was
measured, **21 of 4913 (0.43%) land within a day of optimal**. You will not find one by
trying a few by hand.

The space is 7.29 x 10^16 chains and one costs ~15 s to score, so "try them all" is
3.5 x 10^10 years on one core. [FOR_MATH_NERDS.md](FOR_MATH_NERDS.md) explains how a
search that looks at one chain in ten trillion still lands within hours of the best answer
found -- and which parts of that are measured versus guessed.

## Current answers

**Unconstrained** — no schedule, prestige the instant each target is hit:

| account | chain | duration | plan start | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| main | `195 219 248 286 327 490` | 741.965 d | 2026-09-04 18:51 | **rank 1 of a 4913-chain exhaustive** |
| alt | `133 159 182 201 227 254 290 490` | 948.145 d | 2026-09-04 21:30 | best found |

**With a schedule**, which is a different question and not comparable to the rows above —
prestiges and shifts are held until the player is available and the delay is charged:

| account | chain | duration | window | plan start | ends |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| main | `182 195 228 257 285 322 490` | 739.476 d | 07:00–23:00 | 2026-09-09 19:04 | Mon 2028-09-18 06:29 |
| main | `195 228 257 285 322 490` | 739.476 d | 07:00–23:00 | 2026-09-09 19:04 | Mon 2028-09-18 06:29 |
| alt | `136 161 199 222 252 291 490` | 946.058 d | 09:00–23:00 | 2026-09-11 22:22 | Sat 2029-04-14 23:45 |

The two main rows tie to four decimal places. The **six**-ascension chain finishes at the
same moment as the seven-ascension one, which is one fewer complete rebuild — twelve shifts
and a fresh research grind — for nothing. Prefer it.

**Durations from different plan starts are not comparable** — the end date is the
invariant. This has caused real confusion: a run reporting 741.220 d looked better than
741.965 d and finished five hours *later*.

Comparing the constrained main answer against the older 741.500 d run is also not
straightforward: that one used a 09:00–23:00 window against this one's 07:00–23:00. Across
the **372 chains both runs priced**, the wider window is worth a **median +0.787 d**, so
roughly 1.2 d of the improvement is the last-checkpoint fix and the rest is the extra two
hours a day.

## Setup

This lives on top of [wasmegg-carpet/egg](https://github.com/wasmegg-carpet/egg). Against
that repo's `ascension-planner` branch it is **2 modified files and 15 added**.

### 1. Requirements

- **Node 24+** (26 works)
- **pnpm 8+**
- **Python 3.9+** — `python3` on macOS, and `pip install tzdata` **on Windows only**
  (`zoneinfo` has no system timezone database there; macOS and Linux already have one)

### 2. The two modified files

`package.json` — two script entries:

```json
"search:build": "vite build --config vite.search.config.ts",
"fastsearch":   "node dist-search/fastsearch.js",
```

`src/auto/useAscensionGenerator.ts` — **do not skip this one.** It scores the `continue`
variant against `getOptimalELRSet` instead of whatever is equipped right now. A player
parked in an earnings set had continuing scored at roughly half their real delivery rate,
which hid it as an option entirely. Artifact swaps are free and instant in game, so the
honest comparison is against the best set they can actually field. Every plan here uses
`--force-continue`, so leg A1 is a `continue` leg and this changes its result.

### 3. The files you need

| file | why |
|---|---|
| `scripts/fastsearch.ts` | the harness — wraps the app's own simulator |
| `scripts/node-shims.ts` | **required**; `fastsearch.ts` does `import './node-shims'` |
| `vite.search.config.ts` | bundles the above into `dist-search/` |
| `scripts/autoplan.py` | the staged search driver |
| `scripts/evalchains.py` | score chains you name yourself |

`beam_search.py`, `predict.py`, `bruteforce.py`, `cadence.py`, `shift_timing.py` and
`dbg.ts` are superseded and imported by nothing. Ignore them.

### 4. Build

```bash
pnpm install                 # at the REPO ROOT, not here - it is a workspace install
```

```bash
pnpm search:build            # in this directory; writes dist-search/fastsearch.js
```

`dist-search/` is not committed, so this step is mandatory on a fresh clone.

### 5. Verify before trusting a multi-hour run

```bash
node dist-search/fastsearch.js --backup blind_main.json --final 490 --start-date 2026-09-04 --start-time 18:51 --timezone America/Denver --force-continue --jobs 1 --top 3 --stages "195;219;248;286;327"
```

This must print **`741d 23h`**. That chain is rank 1 of a 4913-chain exhaustive, so if a
new machine reproduces it to the hour, the simulator is faithful. It has been reproduced
on Windows/Node 24 and macOS/Node 26, agreeing to 0.001 d. If you get a different number,
stop — something in the build differs and every result would be suspect.

---

## Running a search

`fastsearch` runs the **same search the browser panel runs** -- it imports
`src/search/driver.ts` and `src/search/chain.ts` directly, so there is one staged search
with two front ends rather than two implementations that can disagree:

```bash
pnpm search:build
node dist-search/fastsearch.js --backup me.json --effort thorough --find-seed --jobs 12 --csv run.csv
```

`node dist-search/fastsearch.js --help` lists every flag, grouped the way the panel groups
its settings. Everything the panel exposes has one: `--effort`, `--seed`, `--find-seed`,
`--min-prestiges` / `--max-prestiges`, `--pin`, `--available-from` / `--available-to` /
`--available-days`, `--no-hold-shifts`, `--milestone`, `--final`, `--start-date` /
`--start-time` / `--timezone`, `--force-continue`, `--csv`.

**`--backup file.json` runs fully offline** -- nothing is fetched, so an air-gapped machine
with a saved backup runs the whole thing. `--player-id` is the only flag that touches the
network, and `--save-backup` writes what it fetched so you only need it once.

### Proving it, rather than trusting it

The staged search returns a strong local optimum. `--exhaustive` prices **every**
strictly-increasing chain over a pool with no staged search and no pruning of any kind, so
its winner is the true optimum of that space:

```bash
node dist-search/fastsearch.js --backup me.json --exhaustive --range 185:390:15 --prestiges 6-7 --jobs 12
```

The chain count and a wall-clock estimate are printed before anything is simulated, and
anything over 5000 chains needs `--yes`. That matters: choosing 6 checkpoints from 185..390
at step 1 is C(206,6) = 8.2e10 chains. Coarsen `--range` until the estimate is bearable,
then narrow around the winner.

### Reading the results (browser)

The panel's runners-up table is one of five **views** over the same priced chains. Switching
re-reads the run's cache and simulates nothing, so it is instant:

| view | what it shows |
|---|---|
| A good mix | the leader, the best chain at each other ascension count, then genuinely different plans. The default, and the only view that filters |
| Fastest | the raw ranking, nothing dropped. Expect near-duplicates: a sweep prices dozens of chains differing by one TE |
| Kindest to my schedule | sorted by time spent waiting for you, not by length |
| By ascension count | best chain at each count. One fewer rebuild for half a day is a trade worth seeing |
| By finish date | one chain per calendar day it could finish on |

**No view filters by schedule fit.** A chain whose shifts land outside your hours is a real
option with a real cost; the cost gets a column and the choice stays yours.

Two behaviours worth knowing because they would otherwise look like bugs. A chain replayed
from a saved checkpoint kept no per-leg detail, so its waiting cost is *unknown* rather than
zero — it sorts last under "Kindest to my schedule" and shows `not recorded`. And "By finish
date" needs a plan start to know which day a chain lands on; without one it falls back to the
ranking rather than collapsing every chain onto the same epoch day.

#### Highlighting one checkpoint's values

Under the shape chart, name a position (`1st checkpoint`, … , `Last before target`) and a few
values — `195, 196, 197`, or `195-200` — and each value gets its own colour, its own count and its
own best-of line, while everything else greys out. It answers the conditional questions a cloud of
25,000 points cannot: what opening on 195 is worth against 196, whether the third checkpoint is
doing anything at all. On one real run, first checkpoint `201-203` came back 201 → 676.923 d over
946 chains, 202 → +6.406 d, 203 → +6.260 d: the opener is worth six days and the choice between
202 and 203 is worth nothing.

Three adjacent values that separate into three clean bands is a real effect. Three that interleave
is not, and that is the point of seeing them at once.

#### The Chain Explorer (everybody's runs)

A separate page, `explorer.html`, reads the collector and groups **every submitted run by ascension
count** — 2, 3, 4, and up. For the count you pick it shows where each checkpoint lands as a
fraction of that account's journey, how long each leg runs, how the peak delivery rate climbs leg
over leg, and which accounts have tried more than one count. Open any run with a stored table and
the full scatter comes with it, highlight and all.

It needs no save file and no player ID, so it hosts anywhere static, GitHub Pages included. See
[collector/README.md](collector/README.md#3-the-chain-explorer-page) for pointing it at a collector
and for the one build flag a Pages deploy needs.

**Help fill the gaps.** A banner at the top jumps to a list, at the bottom beside the upload, of
what the collected runs are still short of -- worked out from the rows, not a fixed list, so each
item drops off once enough accounts cover it (`src/explorer/needs.ts`): more accounts per sweep
preset (M1-M4), accounts outside the measured 126-198 TE range, one save run with force-continue
on and then off, and weaker delivery gear. Each item names the bands to run, fitted to the TE the
viewer types (the first band starts just above it), how many chains that is, and roughly how long
it takes on a laptop, desktop and workstation -- per-chain speeds taken from submitted runs, so
"about". **Run this sweep** opens the planner's Insane mode in a new tab with everything filled in
(`src/search/sweepRequest.ts`); the player enters their ID there, never on the Explorer, picks how
many workers to give it, ticks that they understand how long it takes, and presses Start. The
result submits already tagged with its preset.

### Leaving a long run overnight (browser)

An exhaustive run is hours to days of work in a tab, and the two things that end one early are
both the browser's doing rather than the search's. Neither produces an error in the log, which
is what makes them confusing: you come back to a stopped run, or to a page that says
*"This page is having a problem"* with a crash code.

**Memory.** A priced chain is two things: its answer — a key and a duration, tens of bytes —
and its per-leg detail, which carries each leg's twelve shifts as objects and runs to
kilobytes. Hundreds of thousands of chains of the second thing is how a renderer reaches its
heap ceiling (4 GB in Chrome and Edge on 64-bit; the Insane panel shows the tab's current
usage against it). The panel's **Memory** card sets how many chains keep their detail — the
fastest N, defaulting from `navigator.deviceMemory` where the browser reports it. Everything
past N keeps its duration, which is the answer and what the leaderboard, the CSV totals, the
checkpoint and the proof block are all built from; what is dropped is the per-leg timing for
chains you did not win with. This is the same trade the checkpoint has always made:
`buildCheckpoint` persists `durations` for every chain and `bestLegs` for one.

There is no way for a page to request or cap memory, so "how much should this use" can only be
answered as "how much should it choose to hold". Setting the budget to `0` keeps everything,
which is a real choice for a short run on a machine with room.

**Workers, and what the page can see of your machine.** The panel's **This machine** card shows
everything a web page is actually told: logical cores, the tab's heap limit and current usage,
and `navigator.deviceMemory`. Only the first is accurate. Reported RAM is rounded to a power of
two and clamped to a ceiling the browser picks — anti-fingerprinting, not a bug — so a 64 GB
workstation does not read as 64 GB, and there is no GPU figure at all. That is why the budgets
are knobs rather than something detected: no amount of probing distinguishes "background job
while I work" from "the machine is yours until morning", which is the only input that matters.

Three presets set both knobs together — **Background** (a quarter of your cores, small cache),
**Balanced** (every core but one, the default), **Overnight** (every core, detail for far more
chains) — and both numbers stay visible and editable underneath. Workers default to cores minus
one so the main thread keeps the progress bar painting and Stop responsive; you can spend that
last core, and asking for more than your core count buys nothing, since the workers are CPU-bound
and would only take turns. Each worker also gets its own heap on top of the tab's, which is part
of why the worker count is a memory decision as well as a speed one.

**The worker count can change during a run.** Move the slider (or the Workers field) while a
search is going and the running pool follows: extra workers join from the next batch, and workers
above a lower count stop as soon as the chains they are on are done, so nothing in progress is
lost. An Insane sweep's batches are about a minute long, so that is how soon it takes effect; in a
staged search one wide stage can be a single long batch. The run log notes each change, the speed
estimate re-measures from it, and the run's reported cost uses the time-weighted average worker
count rather than whatever the slider ended on.

**Grids, and the polish after them.** A band like `181-250:5` tries every 5th TE (181, 186, 191,
...), never 227: pricing every TE for four ascensions from TE 198 would be about four million chains,
a month of computing. So an Insane result is the best ON ITS GRID. Durations are jagged -- a leg
that misses its Saturday sale jumps by about three days -- and a coarse grid can step over a faster
chain; a player's Balanced search once beat an M3 sweep by 0.9 d with 227 259 297, none of which is
on that grid. After the sweep, Insane therefore polishes: a Balanced search (coordinate descent,
then every 1-TE pair of adjacent checkpoints) from the grid's winner, count fixed, reusing every
chain already priced. It adds at most a few hundred chains (~630 measured for a 4-ascension chain).
Checked on the main account: a 10-TE grid's best was 280 490 at 871.96 d, and the polish found
279 490 at 850.339 d in 22 more chains, the same answer a complete every-TE sweep gives. The
submission keeps the grid's winner in `space.polish` so the two answers stay distinguishable;
`space.chainsPriced` counts the grid only.

**Background tabs.** The search never pauses itself. "When this tab is in the background" (next to
Keep my PC awake) drops the run to fewer workers while the tab is hidden and goes back to full speed
when it is shown, so someone can use the computer for something else without stopping the run. What
DOES pause a run is the browser freezing a hidden tab (Safari; Chrome and Edge with memory saver or
sleeping tabs), which a page cannot prevent: the pool notices the gap, logs it, and does not charge
it to the run's cost. In Chrome or Edge, "Always keep these sites active" under Settings,
Performance exempts the site.

**The machine sleeping.** A suspended machine stops everything, workers included — the run
resumes from its checkpoint when you come back, and `onSuspend` reports the gap in the run log
rather than pretending the hours happened. While the tab is visible the run takes a **Screen Wake
Lock**, which keeps the display from dimming or locking and on most desktops is what was leading
to the suspend. Two limits worth knowing: the API releases the lock automatically whenever the
tab is hidden or the window minimised and it cannot be re-taken until the tab is visible again
(the run re-requests it on `visibilitychange`), and it argues only with the *display* timeout. A
system sleep timer, a lid close, or a manual sleep still suspends the machine. If you leave runs
overnight, set the OS to never sleep while plugged in — that is the setting that covers it, and
nothing in the page can substitute for it.

**Freezing and discarding.** These are two different mechanisms and only one of them can be
argued with from code.

- *Freezing* (Chrome/Edge Energy Saver) suspends a tab's task queues once every page in the
  group has been hidden and silent for about five minutes. Chromium's freezing policy has an
  explicit opt-out list, and one entry on it is a page "holding a Web Lock or an IndexedDB
  transaction" — so the run takes a Web Lock for its whole duration. That is not a trick; it
  is the documented way to say this tab is doing something.
- *Discarding* (Memory Saver) kills a background tab outright under memory pressure. **No API
  prevents it.** There is no event before it happens; the page only learns about it afterwards,
  via `document.wasDiscarded` on the reload. The defences are the checkpoint and the memory
  budget, not code that asks the browser to stop.

If you leave runs overnight, exempt the site in the browser itself:

| browser | where |
|---|---|
| Chrome | `chrome://settings/performance` → Memory Saver → **Always keep these sites active** |
| Edge | `edge://settings/system` → Sleeping tabs → **Never put these sites to sleep** |

The run also checkpoints on `visibilitychange` as well as on its timer, because
`beforeunload` and `unload` do **not** fire when a tab is discarded — going hidden is the last
moment a page is reliably given.

### Submitting, and what the messages mean

**Submit result** sends two things: a small summary (the chain, its duration, the inventory it was
simulated with) and, if ticked, the full chain table gzipped. They are separate requests on purpose
-- the summary is the part that must land. The collector hands back a one-time token with the
summary, and only a table carrying that token is accepted, once (see
[collector/README.md](collector/README.md#2-the-collector)).

| message | what happened | what to do |
|---|---|---|
| **Didn't start** — *your save had not finished loading* | Start was pressed before the save finished arriving. The run refuses rather than simulate a half-loaded account, which gives a confident answer two to three times too long | Wait a few seconds after the player loads and press Start again |
| *no virtue ascension in progress, so the plan starts with a fresh one* (amber note) | The save's last sync was on the home farm or a contract, so there is no current run to finish. Not an error: leg 1 is a fresh virtue ascension, the same thing the player would do | Nothing. To plan from a run in progress instead, switch to a virtue egg in the game, let it sync, and reload |
| **Search failed** — *the connection dropped while the search was starting its workers* | The workers' code could not be downloaded | Reconnect and press Start. Anything priced is checkpointed and not redone |
| **Search failed** — *the browser ran out of memory* | Too many workers, or too much per-leg detail held | Fewer workers, or a smaller memory budget, then Start |
| *could not reach the collector* | Offline at the moment of Submit. Nothing was sent | Press Submit again once online. Save the file instead keeps a copy either way |
| *too many submissions from your connection* | More than 10 in a minute from one address | Wait the seconds it says; nothing was lost |
| *sent, but the table did not upload* (amber) | The summary is in; the table was cut off | **Retry the table** sends just the table, with the same token. Submitting again would add a second row |
| *sent, but the table was refused* (amber) | The token did not match -- in practice a tab running a build from before the collector's upload rules changed | Save first (Save this run, Save the file instead or Download CSV), reload, submit again |
| **A newer version of this page is live** (banner) | This tab's code is older than what is deployed | Save, then Reload. A running search resumes from its checkpoint |

**Going offline mid-run is fine.** The search runs entirely in the browser: once the save is loaded
and the workers are up, no leg needs the network. The connection matters at three moments only --
loading the save, starting workers (their code is downloaded then), and submitting. The site
itself is served from one machine: if that machine goes down, open tabs keep running and
submissions still land, because they go straight to the collector on Cloudflare.

**The new-version check** fetches `version.json` (about 90 bytes, written by the build: each
page's hashed entry script) when the tab comes back into view or back online, and otherwise while
visible every minute on a desktop or every 5 on a phone, tablet or data-saver connection. Open tabs
share one check over a BroadcastChannel, so ten tabs cost one request and all show the banner
together. A rebuild that changed no code writes the same file, so nobody is told to reload for
nothing. A host without the file falls back to comparing the page's HTML
(`src/composables/useNewVersion.ts`).

### The older Python driver

`scripts/autoplan.py` predates the shared driver and reimplements the staged search in
Python, driving `fastsearch --stages` batch by batch. It still works and its flags are
unchanged:

```bash
python scripts/autoplan.py --player-id EI1234567890123456 --backup me.json --effort balanced --jobs 12 --yes
```

Prefer `--effort` on `fastsearch` for anything new. The duplication is not free: the
`resolve_last` bug that left the last checkpoint unswept existed in **both** copies and had
to be found and fixed twice.

### Effort tiers

The stages are strictly nested, so a tier is a **stop point**. Picking a higher tier and
losing patience still leaves you the lower tier's answer.

| tier | stages | time | measured accuracy |
|---|---|---|---|
| `quick` | descent | ~1h05m | 0 / 5 / 5 / 61 / **150** h behind the best found (5 obs) |
| `balanced` | + 2-D slices | ~2h55m | 1.3 h and 0 h (2 accounts) |
| `normal` | + count probe | ~3h30m | **exact** — matched the 4913-chain exhaustive (n=1) |
| `thorough` | + 3-D slices | 7–13 h | one 1.665 d win on the alt; nothing to add on the main |

> **Every figure in that table was measured before the last-checkpoint sweep was fixed**, and
> they are therefore **pessimistic by an unknown amount**. On the main the fix was worth
> roughly 1.2 d on its own; on the alt it changed nothing, because the bug only bit when the
> coarse scan proposed a last checkpoint above `maxLast` and the alt's never did. Re-measuring
> the tiers is several account-days of compute and has not been done. Treat the table as a
> floor, not an estimate.

Accuracy is stated as hours behind the best answer *found*, with the sample size. There
are no confidence percentages here on purpose: three to five observations cannot honestly
be turned into one.

`quick` has always landed inside a week and usually inside a day, but the spread is real —
two runs on the same account 5.5 hours apart differed by **6 days**, because descent alone
is basin-sensitive and nothing after it re-checks the neighbourhood. Use it to get a good
answer in under an hour, not to get *the* answer.

### Flags worth knowing

| flag | effect |
|---|---|
| `--max-hours N` | refuses to start a configuration projected past N hours. **Off by default** — the projection is printed either way and a long run is your call |
| `--jobs N` | worker cap. The pool is sized **per batch** — see below |
| `--csv FILE` | where the per-leg CSV goes. Honoured with `--jobs` > 1 too (it used to be ignored there, and every sharded run overwrote `fastsearch.csv`) |
| `--start-date` / `--start-time` | plan start. Defaults to the current date and hour **in `--timezone`** (the date used to be UTC's, so an evening run in the Americas was dated a day ahead) |
| `--force-continue` | finish the current ascension first **when that takes under a week**; longer than that, leg 1 compares continue with the 1/2/3-sale fresh starts and takes the fastest (measured: continue always won under a week, and lost to a fresh 2-sale start on longer first legs, e.g. 120.9 vs 99.6 days). **The browser defaults this on; the CLI defaults it off** -- pass it to match the panel. It changes the answer: one account's best 2-ascension plan moved 135 days |
| `--jobs-fixed` | honour `--jobs` literally instead of sizing per batch |
| `--mod elr=1.05` | colleggtible what-if: scales one modifier dimension |
| `--add-artifact metronome:legendary` | artifact what-if: injects into the **virtue** inventory |
| `--seed "195 219 248"` | skip the coarse scan and start from a chain you supply |
| `--radius N` | descent/slice window (default 8) |
| `--sleep-from 23 --sleep-until 7` | when you sleep. Changes the answer — see below |
| `--available-from 8 --available-to 22 --available-days sat,sun` | the general form of the same thing |
| `--prestiges 5-8` | how many ascensions the plan may use |
| `--pin N` | hold the first N checkpoints fixed |
| `--milestone "248@2027-06-01"` | a date you have to hit. Repeatable. Drops chains that miss it |

### Picking `--jobs`

Set it to roughly half your logical cores and stop thinking about it. On a 20-core box a
fixed 152-chain batch varied only **7.9%** across `--jobs` 6/12/17 — and the *perfectly
balanced* 17-way split was the slowest of the three, so shard balance is not the variable.

What does matter is batch size. Every shard is a fresh node process loading a 6.2 MB
bundle, and those loads contend. On a MacBook, stage 2 (one 372-chain batch) ran at
**1.43 s/chain** while stage 4 (many 13–17 chain batches) ran at **19.68 s/chain** at the
same `--jobs 12`, and 5.1 s/chain at `--jobs 6`. `Sim.jobs_for` now keeps at least
`CHAINS_PER_SHARD` chains per process, so a 13-chain batch gets 4 workers and the coarse
scan still gets all 12.

### Your schedule (`--sleep-from`/`--sleep-until`, `--available-*`)

Two spellings of one thing. `--sleep-from 23 --sleep-until 7` is the common case;
`--available-from 8 --available-to 22 --available-days sat,sun` is the general form. Days
are comma separated names or 0–6 (Sunday first), hours are whole and read in `--timezone`.
`--available-days` works alone to mean "those days, any hour". An hour window may wrap:
`--available-from 18 --available-to 2` is evenings into the night, and the back half of
such a session counts as belonging to the day it *started* on.

**What it does.** A leg ends the instant its target TE is reached, and the plan's next
instruction is a prestige — you cannot start the next ascension without it. Each inter-leg
prestige that would land while you are away is moved to your next available hour and the
delay is **charged**, which shifts every downstream Research Sale boundary. That is why it
has to be set before the search starts: it changes which chain is fastest, and it cannot be
applied to an answer afterwards.

Measured on the main account's proven optimum, browser and CLI agreeing to the hour:

```
195 219 248 286 327 490        unconstrained          741.965 d
  awake 07:00-23:00, any day   ->  745.789 d   (+3.8 d)
  weekends only, 08:00-22:00   ->  767.0   d   (+25.0 d)
```

Only ~9.6 h of the first is waiting. The rest is the knock-on: A4's 6.5 h push moved the
final build past a sale boundary, and the final leg's strategy flipped from `1-sale-tier13`
to `2-sale-tier13`. Both figures are for that **fixed** chain — re-optimising under the
constraint is the whole reason the schedule lives in the objective rather than in a report,
and the weekend-only number in particular should improve a lot once the checkpoints are
free to move.

**What it does not do.** Only the prestige between ascensions is moved. The twelve shifts
inside an ascension are scheduled by the simulator's own `te-wait` logic and are **not**
moved — on the awake-hours run above, 5 of 72 still land at night. The CSV's
`A*_nightshifts` columns count them per leg. The delay is also charged in full while the
extra TE you keep earning while away is not credited, so a plan built this way should if
anything run marginally faster than it says.

Every accuracy figure in the effort table above was measured with **no schedule**. Chains
scored with and without one are not comparable.

New CSV columns: `A*_wait_h` (hours that prestige waited) and `A*_nightshifts`.

### The rules (`src/search/rules.ts`)

Policy, set 2026-09-24, in one module the page, the health checks and the CLI all read.

- **Continue (leg 1).** Taken outright when finishing the current ascension takes under a week (it
  was the fastest variant every time it did, across four accounts). From a week to six months it is
  compared with fresh 1/2/3-sale starts and **stays the default**: a fresh start wins only when it is
  strictly faster. Past three months a continue leg 1 carries a warning (with an easter egg). Past six
  months continue is not offered at all. `--continue-pin-days` / `--continue-max-days` change the two
  limits for experiments.
- **Integrity (accounts that stall).** Before any chain is priced, a fresh ascension from the plan
  start is simulated up to its build phase and the time it sits on its first Integrity shift is
  measured. Healthy accounts: median under ten minutes, never more than 54 (about 25,000 fresh legs,
  and 28 plan starts each on two accounts). Over an **hour** the run warns, with how long, and its
  result goes to the flagged board. Over a **week** it does not start. The CLI prints the check on
  every run and refuses the same way unless `--allow-stall`.
- **Board hygiene.** A result from a stalled account, a plan past ten years, or one whose delivery
  collapses between legs is **flagged**: stored apart, shown on the Chain Explorer's flagged board, and
  anonymous to everyone except the browser that sent it (a random per-account code kept in
  localStorage; the collector stores only its hash).
- **Stale saves** (`src/lib/saveAge.ts`). The plan starts **now** by default, and the farm is caught
  up from its last sync to the start at its current rate (Joo's catch-up in `computeSnapshot` and
  `runContinueCurrent`), buying nothing in between. The catch-up stops at what the **silos** hold (silo
  count x Silo Capacity research), as the game caps time away, and a save older than that gets a
  warning: the sync is old, or something was missed. The note under the start time says which.

### Time off from virtue (`--time-off`)

Egg Day, a week chasing a legendary on the home farm. Whole local dates, repeatable:
`--time-off 2027-07-14 --time-off 2027-08-01:2027-08-07`; in the browser, "Time off from virtue"
beside the schedule. **The ascension in progress ends when the time off starts** and keeps the TE it
reached; nothing happens while away; coming back is a **complete rebuild**, a fresh ascension toward
the same checkpoint (never a continue). The search prices every chain with those gaps in it, so the
winner is the best plan around the time off. A build that cannot finish before the time off is lost
and starts again after it. The CSV marks the two legs `stopped` / `restarted` in a `time_off` column.
Needs `--exhaustive` or `--effort` (the shared evaluator); the `--stages` path refuses it.

### Dated milestones (`--milestone`)

`--milestone "248@2027-06-01"`, repeatable. A chain that misses one is **dropped** — not
ranked lower, dropped — so this steers the search rather than annotating the answer. It
reuses the path a chain whose simulation failed already takes, which is why it needs no
change to `driver.ts`.

Stated as a **TE value, not an ascension number**, and that is deliberate. The
prestige-count probe adds and removes checkpoints, so "A3" means a different TE before and
after stage 7 — a constraint whose meaning changes mid-search is not a constraint. A TE
value is stable however the chain is reshaped, and it is also the thing a player is
actually waiting for.

A milestone is met when some leg ends **at or above** that TE at or before the deadline
(end of the named day, in `--timezone`). Reaching a TE is not an action, so the raw leg end
is the right instant even under a schedule — you hit the number while asleep just the same.

**A milestone on `--final` cannot improve anything.** The search already minimises total
time, so the fastest chain is by construction the one most likely to meet a deadline on the
final target; if the optimum misses your date, nothing else makes it. All such a milestone
can do is turn "here is the earliest you can finish" into "no chain found". Intermediate
milestones are the ones that change which chain wins.

When nothing is feasible the run says so and reports nothing, because a rejected chain is
never priced or ranked. Relax the tightest date to see how close the fastest plan gets.

## What is worth chasing

### Colleggtibles

One additional colleggtible at T4, chain re-optimised, on the main account:

| dimension | days saved | note |
|---|---|---|
| away earnings ×3 | **23.5** | compresses the build phases; the final leg gets *longer* |
| egg laying rate +5% | 20.4 | |
| hab capacity +5% | 20.4 | **bit-identical to ELR** across five tested magnitudes |
| shipping capacity +5% | 19.4 | attacks the final leg instead of the build |
| research cost −5% | 0.3 | |
| internal hatchery, vehicle cost, hab cost | **exactly 0** | at every tier |

A 25% hab-cost cut and a 10% vehicle-cost cut change nothing at all — the plan is
time-limited, not cash-limited.

The tier ladders have opposite shapes, which changes whether a partial egg is worth
chasing:

```
                  T1     T2     T3     T4
elr / habCap     0.08   3.05   6.85  15.30   CONVEX  - all the value at T4
shippingCap      4.37   8.37  12.14  15.14   CONCAVE - pays from T1
```

A shipping egg is worth 4.4 days at T1 alone. An ELR egg's first three tiers are worth
almost nothing; only the 10B farm matters.

**Fixed-chain estimates systematically understate, and unevenly enough to reorder the
ranking** — re-optimising added +5.1 d to ELR but +13.5 d to away earnings, which moved
away earnings from third place to first. Always re-optimise before comparing.

### Artifacts

The **virtue inventory is separate from the main game's**. You can hold legendary
compasses in the main game and only epics in virtue, which is exactly the case here.

| account | upgrade | days saved |
|---|---|---|
| alt | legendary metronome **+** legendary puzzle cube | **45.3** |
| alt | legendary metronome alone | 28 |
| alt | legendary puzzle cube alone | 7 |
| main | legendary interstellar compass | 15.7 |
| alt | the chalice (IHR) | 0 |
| main | book of basan, phoenix feather | 0 |

The metronome and cube are **superadditive** — 45.3 together against 35 apart. A cheaper
research cost lets the farm reach the higher lay rate sooner.

## What does not work

Do not spend time re-deriving these. All are measured; see "The measurement record" at
the end of this file.

- **Predicting a chain's duration without simulating.** A feature-based surrogate got
  Spearman ρ = −0.053, median error 15.6 days, and 0/100 overlap with the true top 100.
  The true top 100 spans 1.66 days while unmodelled farm state moves a single leg 1.0–2.6
  days.
- **Pruning by prefix cost.** Unsafe: a prefix arriving later can arrive with a higher
  delivery rate and win overall.
- **`--prune` as implemented.** Measured: pruned 0 of 69 chains.
- **A closed-form final leg.** The earn phase is already a single division; the main's
  406-day final leg carries 0.748 days of simulated build phase.
- **Any "stop when it turns up" rule.** The landscape is not unimodal: a measured
  envelope falls after a rise.
- **Widening the descent radius past 8.** A replay from all 4913 exhaustive grid points
  put the knee at radius 4 and exactness at 7.

The consequence: every checkpoint value must be simulated to be known. The
exactness-preserving speedups available total **5–7 minutes on a 209-minute run**. The
only three levers are: simulate fewer chains, simulate them faster, or accept a worse
answer — which is what the effort slider sells.

---

## Known limitations

- **The build logic is tuned for accounts past ~200 Clothed TE, and very low accounts plan badly.**
  One 93 TE account with weak gear spent ~480 days of its first simulated ascension stuck on one
  egg at 0.27 q/hr, in every chain priced, while its later ascensions ran normally -- so every total
  for that account is inflated by roughly that much. The same effect is behind the panel's existing
  low-Clothed-TE warning. Low-TE runs are still worth collecting, as evidence of where it breaks.
- **Insane mode's suggested bands are measured on accounts starting between 126 and 198 TE.**
  They are fixed TE values now, not fractions of the journey (the checkpoint that sets up the
  final leg lands near 280-300 TE whatever the start, where delivery reaches its ceiling), but
  below 126 the first band is a guess. The Chain Explorer lists low-TE runs as a gap.

- **`--effort thorough` projects to 7–13 h.** No longer refused (`--max-hours` is off by
  default and the projection is printed, so the call is yours). Stage 6 has exactly one
  measured win — **1.665 d (40 h) on the alt**, where an exhaustive X4xX5xX6 slice beat the
  2-D-polished answer and the recipe ranked 55 of 2197 — but that predates the fix that
  taught stage 5 to sweep the last adjacent pair, so how much of those 40 h stage 5 now
  catches on its own is **unmeasured**. On the main, a 4913-chain 3-D exhaustive matched the
  recipe exactly. Stage 6 is also ~74% of the tier's chains and runs *before* the
  prestige-count probe, which gates the one stage that produced the main's proven answer.
- **No full browser run has been observed to completion.** The ported evaluator reproduces
  741.965 exactly and stages 2–7 are all present (`src/search/*.spec.ts`, 56 tests), but
  the longest observed browser run is a partial `thorough` still in progress.
- **Serving the app over plain HTTP on a LAN breaks it.** `crypto.subtle` only exists in a
  secure context, so `hashID()` throws and every IndexedDB write fails. Use `localhost`,
  or put it behind HTTPS (a Cloudflare tunnel works).
- **Per-leg and per-pass timing are not recorded.** `autoplan.py` captures fastsearch's
  output only on failure, so its own `leg sims` counts are discarded. Several cost figures
  here are reconstructed from stage timestamps rather than measured.
- **Shifts are held by a delay model, not by the simulator.** With "hold the shifts for my
  hours too" on, each of the twelve in-ascension switches is pushed to the next available
  instant on top of the simulated timeline and the accumulated delay moves the leg's end.
  That is right to first order and errs one way only -- while you wait the farm keeps laying
  the egg you have not switched away from, and that progress is not credited. An exact
  answer needs `auto/shifts/te-wait.ts` to schedule around availability itself, which would
  change the manual planner too. With the box off, shifts are reported and free.
- **The artifact inventory is held fixed for the entire plan.** The search reads the virtue
  inventory out of the backup once and assumes it never changes across ~740 days, which it
  will not -- you will craft and upgrade. The bias is in the safe direction (the real run
  should beat these dates) and comparisons *between* chains stay fair because every
  candidate is handicapped identically, but the absolute dates drift, worst at the far end.
  The panel shows the inventory it used and says so; the CSV header records it too. Re-run
  after significant crafting.
- **The browser's CSV export loses per-leg detail across a refresh, and past the memory
  budget.** A checkpoint keeps `legs` for the best chain alone, so replayed chains export
  their total with the per-leg cells blank. Chains priced in the current session are complete
  up to the Insane panel's memory budget, past which the slowest chains are stripped to their
  durations while the run is still going — see *Leaving a long run overnight*. Both are the
  same trade and both are visible in the CSV the same way.

## The measurement record

Every accuracy figure, refuted claim and self-correction in this document comes from a
findings log and a set of run artifacts kept in the author's working repository: an
append-only findings log, a 4913-chain exhaustive CSV that is the ground truth behind
"rank 1 of 4913", and the blind held-out validation runs behind the effort-tier figures.
Those are not shipped here -- they are a few megabytes of one player's run logs, and they
carry that player's save data by reference. Ask if you want them for review.

What *is* shipped is the part anyone can re-run: `src/search/*.spec.ts`, including a
fixture test that reproduces the CLI's 741d 23h to the hour against a real backup, and the
CLI itself -- so any claim here can be checked against your own account.

See [FOR_MATH_NERDS.md](FOR_MATH_NERDS.md) for the combinatorics, the dead ends with their
numbers, and an explicit split between what is measured and what is a hunch.
