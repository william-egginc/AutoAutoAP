/**
 * Cloudflare Worker: collects chain-search submissions and serves the leaderboard.
 *
 * Deploy this and point the app's `VITE_SUBMIT_URL` at `https://<worker>/submit`. Everything
 * lives in one Worker plus one KV namespace, because the whole dataset is a few thousand small
 * JSON objects and reaching for a database would be borrowing trouble.
 *
 *   POST /submit       one submission, validated, stored, rate-limited by IP
 *   GET  /leaderboard  ?final=490&limit=50  -> the best chain per submitter
 *   GET  /all          everything, for anyone who wants to do their own analysis
 *   GET  /             the leaderboard page (see leaderboard.html)
 *
 * VALIDATION IS DUPLICATED ON PURPOSE. `validateSubmission` in src/search/submission.ts is the
 * same ruleset, and the app runs it before sending -- but a public endpoint cannot trust that
 * the thing posting to it is the app. The rules are kept identical by being short enough to read
 * side by side; if they drift, the Worker's copy is the one that matters.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT STORE. No IP addresses beyond a rate-limit key that lives in
 * KV under a 60-second TTL and is never read back into any record, no headers, no cookies,
 * nothing derived from the connection. A submission is what the
 * player chose to send and nothing more. If you change that, change the consent text in the app
 * to match -- people agreed to a specific list.
 *
 * Setup:
 *   wrangler kv namespace create SUBMISSIONS
 *   # put the returned id in wrangler.toml, then:
 *   wrangler deploy
 */

// 2: `artifacts` became a list of labels (best piece per family) instead of `{label, count}` for
// every tier owned; see src/search/submission.ts. Rows already in KV at schema 1 keep their old
// shape and the page renders both -- a stored row is history, not something to migrate.
const SCHEMA = 6;

/**
 * Schemas this Worker will accept, newest last.
 *
 * NOT just `SCHEMA`. The app and the Worker deploy separately and never at the same instant, so
 * insisting on an exact match guarantees a window where every submission is refused -- which is
 * exactly what happened when 3 shipped in the app first: "collector said 400: unknown schema 3",
 * with the sender given nothing to do about it.
 *
 * 3 is purely additive over 2 (run cost, epic research, colleggtibles, all optional), 4 adds
 * `space` and 5 adds `proof`, both Insane-only and both optional, so a
 * schema-2 row is a valid row that happens to carry none of them, and storing it is strictly better
 * than rejecting the run that produced it. The `schema` field is stored as sent, so a reader can
 * still tell which rows can have timing data and which cannot.
 *
 * 6 adds the virtue variables (weekday, delivery score, Clothed TE, TE per egg, backup age) and the
 * upload page's sweep tag and machine block. All optional, so the same reasoning holds.

/**
 * Bounds on everything countable.
 *
 * These are not guesses about malice so much as the values past which a submission stops
 * describing a plan anybody ran: a real chain is single digits of ascensions and a real answer
 * is a few hundred days.
 *
 * DURATION_DAYS is the one that is load-bearing rather than tidy. The KV key embeds
 * `round(days * 10000)` zero-padded to ten characters so that listing a prefix returns the board
 * already in duration order. A value large enough to need an eleventh character -- or large
 * enough that `String()` renders it in exponential form -- sorts ABOVE every genuine entry and
 * takes the top of the leaderboard. Measured before this cap existed: `durationDays: 1e24` was
 * accepted and stored as `sub:490:000001e+28:...`, first in the scan. 100000 days is 274 years,
 * far past any real plan, and `100000 * 10000` is exactly ten digits.
