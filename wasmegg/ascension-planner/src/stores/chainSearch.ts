/**
 * Drives a chain search from the browser: gathers the Pinia-resolved inputs, owns the worker pool,
 * runs the driver, and keeps the live progress the UI renders.
 *
 * WHY THE STORE OWNS THE POOL. useResearchCalcWorker.ts ties its worker to a component via
 * `onUnmounted`, which is right for a computation that only matters while a tab is open. A chain
 * search runs for HOURS; its lifetime belongs to the run, not to whichever component happens to be
 * mounted. So the pool is created in `start()` and terminated in `stop()`/on completion, and the
 * component below it is free to unmount and remount without disturbing anything.
 *
 * ALL PINIA READS HAPPEN HERE, ON THE MAIN THREAD, ONCE. `getSimulationContext()` and
 * `createBaseEngineState(null)` (engine/adapter.ts) throw immediately outside a Pinia context, which
 * a worker never has — the same split researchCalc.worker.ts documents. Everything the simulation
 * itself calls is already Pinia-free.
