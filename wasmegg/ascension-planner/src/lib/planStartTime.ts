/**
 * @module planStartTime
 * @description Decides what instant an Auto-AP plan should start from.
 *
 * The farm a plan is built on is copied out of the backup verbatim (`initialState.currentFarmState`)
 * and is never advanced, so it describes one specific moment: `Backup.approx_time`, the figure the
 * page header shows as "Player Backup From". The plan's start time is a separate input, and when
 * the two disagree the simulator is being asked to run a farm from one instant against a clock from
 * another.
 *
 * That gap is not cosmetic. Every leg is timed from the end of the leg before it, so an error in
 * the first start time is carried through the whole chain, and it moves legs across Research Sale
 * boundaries, which is the structure the whole search depends on (see FOR_MATH_NERDS.md). Hence:
 * default the start to the backup's own timestamp.
 *
 * Pure and separate from the component so the cases below can be tested directly; the component
 * only converts between these numbers and the date/time input strings.

 * - Start before the backup: replaced. This asks the simulator to begin before the state it is
 *   starting from existed, and it is what a stale cached form from a previous visit produces.
 * - Start after the backup: left alone. "I will begin this plan tomorrow morning" is a legitimate
 *   thing to ask for, and the UI warns about the drift rather than overriding the choice.
 * - No backup at all: left alone, since there is nothing better to sync to.
