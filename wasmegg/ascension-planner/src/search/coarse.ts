/**
 * Stages 2 and 3: find a starting chain from nothing, and fix the prestige count.
 *
 * A line-faithful port of `coarse()` and `ladder_pick()` from scripts/autoplan.py. Without
 * these the browser search could only improve a chain the user typed, and a bad starting
 * chain strands the search in a bad neighbourhood — the panel said so, and this closes it.
 *
 * Cost is real: the coarse scan is one big batch (372 chains on both measured accounts,
 * ~15 min on a 20-core desktop) and it buys only a rough shape. After it, the incumbent
 * was 12.0 days off on the main and 8.6 days off on the alt — it is a starting point, not
 * an answer. It is also the single stage that parallelises well, because it is one wide
 * batch rather than the 13-17 chain sweeps every later stage runs.
