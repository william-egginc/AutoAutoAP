/**
 * Named ways of looking at the chains a run priced.
 *
 * `pickShortlist` answers one question well — "show me eight genuinely different options near the
 * top" — and it answers it opinionatedly: anything more than five days behind is dropped, and
 * same-length chains within six TE of one already shown are treated as duplicates. That is the
 * right default and the wrong thing to be stuck with. A player who wants the ten outright fastest,
 * or the best chain at every ascension count, or one option per finish date, was being shown a
 * curated eight and told the rest "was almost certainly never evaluated" — which is true of chains
 * the search never visited and false of the nine thousand sitting in the cache.
 *
 * So the shortlist becomes one VIEW among several over the same priced entries. Every view reads
 * the run's own cache, none of them re-simulates anything, and switching is instant.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE FILTERS BY SCHEDULE FIT. A chain whose shifts land outside your hours is a real
 * option with a real cost, and hiding it makes the decision for the player. The cost is shown in
 * its own column instead; `cheapest-hours` sorts BY it for anyone who wants that to be the
 * priority, and `fastest` ignores it for anyone who does not.
