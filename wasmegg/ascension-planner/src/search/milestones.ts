/**
 * Dated milestones: "be at 248 TE by the first of June".
 *
 * WHY TE AND A DATE, NOT "ASCENSION 3 BY A DATE". A per-ascension deadline sounds more natural and
 * is the wrong handle: the prestige-count probe adds and removes checkpoints, so "A3" silently
 * means a different TE before and after stage 7, and a constraint whose meaning changes mid-search
 * is not a constraint. A TE value is stable no matter how the chain is reshaped, and it is also
 * what a player actually cares about — the checkpoint number is an implementation detail of the
 * plan, the truth-egg count is the thing they are waiting for.
 *
 * A chain SATISFIES a milestone when some leg ends at or above that TE at or before the deadline.
 * Reaching a TE is not an action, so the raw leg end is the right instant even under an
 * availability schedule — you hit the number while asleep just the same, you simply cannot prestige
 * on it yet.
 *
 * HOW IT STEERS THE SEARCH. A chain that misses a milestone is dropped exactly the way a chain
 * whose simulation failed is dropped — `chain.ts` returns null and the driver already treats a
 * missing chain as "not a candidate", never as an error. That is deliberate: it means dated
 * milestones need no change at all to driver.ts, the one file in this search whose comments open
 * with "READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING ANY OF IT".
 *
 * The cost of that simplicity is the all-infeasible case: if nothing satisfies the milestones the
 * search has nothing to return and the caller sees no finite answer. The panel detects that and
 * says so, rather than rendering `Infinity d`.
 *
 * A MILESTONE ON THE FINAL TARGET IS ALMOST ALWAYS REDUNDANT, and it is worth knowing why before
 * adding one. The search already minimises total time, so the fastest chain is by construction the
 * one most likely to meet a deadline on the final target — if the optimum misses it, nothing else
 * makes it either. Such a milestone cannot improve the answer; it can only turn "here is the
 * earliest you can finish" into "no chain found", which is strictly less information. Intermediate
 * milestones are the ones that genuinely change which chain wins.
