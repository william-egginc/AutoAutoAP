/**
 * @module runLibrary
 * @description Named, reloadable chain-search runs, the way the plan library holds plans.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. `persistence.ts` already checkpoints a run, but to ONE slot
 * (`METADATA_KEY = 'chainSearchRun'`) that only resumes onto an identical fingerprint. Change the
 * target TE, the plan start, or your current TE, and it is unusable. Finish a search, start a
 * different one, and the first is gone except whatever CSV was downloaded. That is a crash guard,
 * not a history.
 *
 * This keeps runs deliberately, under names, and reloads any of them at any time.
 *
 * WHAT IS STORED, AND THE SIZE PROBLEM. The valuable thing is the chain -> duration cache: every
 * entry is roughly fifteen seconds of CPU. It is also the big thing -- an 11,000-chain run is
 * megabytes. So the index is kept separately from the bodies: listing the library reads one small
 * record, and a run's cache is only loaded when it is opened. The library is capped by count and
 * the oldest is evicted, because the alternative is discovering the quota is full at the end of a
 * three-hour run.
 *
 * Per-leg summaries are kept for the best chain only, the same trade `persistence.ts` makes and
 * for the same reason: keeping them for every cached chain multiplies the record by about six for
 * information nothing reads.
