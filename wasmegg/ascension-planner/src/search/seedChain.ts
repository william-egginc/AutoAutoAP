/**
 * @module seedChain
 * @description Builds the chain the search starts from when the user has not supplied one, and
 * reports why a supplied one will not work.
 *
 * WHY THE SEED'S LENGTH IS LOAD-BEARING. Coordinate descent only MOVES checkpoints, and the
 * prestige-count probe adds at most one, so a search cannot grow a 2-checkpoint seed into the
 * 6-checkpoint answer the Limits box is asking for. A short seed does not make the search slower;
 * it makes the requested answer unreachable. Defaulting to `<final>` alone, or to whatever single
 * number happened to be in the Target TE field, quietly did exactly that.
 *
 * SPACING. Checkpoints are spaced geometrically rather than evenly, because measured optima are:
 * `195 226 277 317 490` and `195 219 248 286 327 490` both open with small gaps and widen. A
 * seed only has to land in the right basin for descent to polish, so this is deliberately a shape
 * rather than a prediction, and the coarse scan ("find a starting chain for me") remains the
 * better option for anyone without a chain they trust.

 * run on the seed at whatever length it arrives, so a 5-ascension seed under a maximum of 4 is
 * explored as a 5 and comes back as a 5.

 * `countProbe` is therefore load-bearing: on Quick and Balanced the probe does not run at all, so
 * nothing anywhere in the run will change the seed's length and the limits are decorative. On
 * Normal and Thorough the probe can add or drop exactly one checkpoint, so a seed one outside the
