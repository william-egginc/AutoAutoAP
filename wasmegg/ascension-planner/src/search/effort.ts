/**
 * Effort tiers and what is actually known about them.
 *
 * Ported verbatim from `EFFORT`/`EFFORT_NOTE` in scripts/autoplan.py, including the numbers. Two
 * rules govern everything in this file and they are not stylistic:
 *
 *   1. The stages are strictly NESTED (resolve_last -> descent -> 2-D slices -> count probe), so a
 *      tier is a STOP POINT, not a different algorithm. A user who picks a higher tier and loses
 *      patience already holds the lower tier's answer at zero extra cost. The UI says so out loud,
 *      because it is the thing that makes "Stop" a safe button.
 *   2. Accuracy is stated as HOURS BEHIND THE BEST ANSWER FOUND, with the sample size attached, and
 *      never as a confidence percentage. n is 3 accounts. There is no honest way to turn three
 *      observations into a probability, and inventing one would be the most damaging thing this
 *      feature could do — the user is deciding whether to spend three hours on the answer.
 *
 * "Best answer FOUND" is deliberate: only the main account has a proven optimum (a complete
 * 4913-chain exhaustive), and even that proves optimality only inside a box with the first two
 * checkpoints, the final target and the checkpoint count all pinned.
