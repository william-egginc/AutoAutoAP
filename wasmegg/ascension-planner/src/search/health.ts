/**
 * @module health
 * @description Sanity checks on what a run was given and what it produced.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. An exhaustive run is hours of CPU against a farm state loaded once at the start.
 * If that state is wrong -- a backup that half-loaded, an inventory that came back empty, a
 * post-prestige state the simulator got wrong -- nothing fails. Every chain is priced consistently
 * against the same wrong world, the ranking between them is internally coherent, and the answer is
 * confidently three times too slow. The run looks exactly like a good one.
 *
 * Measured, from a real report: a six-ascension chain came back at 2,277 days where the same
 * account's official planner said 736. The first leg matched to three decimals (3.574 q/hr), and
 * the second collapsed to 0.320 q/hr for 817 days -- a tenth of the leg before it, on a farm that
 * had just gained 17 TE. Nothing in the UI said a word, because a search has no opinion about
 * whether its inputs are sane.
 *
 * So these are the opinions. They are deliberately CRUDE: every one of them is a statement about
 * the physics of the game rather than a threshold tuned to one account, because a threshold tuned
 * to one account is a false alarm on everybody else's.
