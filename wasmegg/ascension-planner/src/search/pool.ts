/**
 * The chain-search worker pool: `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` workers, the browser's answer to the
 * CLI harness's `--jobs 12`.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a composable, unlike useResearchCalcWorker.ts. That one ties its worker's
 * lifetime to a component via `onUnmounted`, which is right for a computation that only matters
 * while a tab is open. A chain search runs for HOURS and must survive the user navigating around the
 * planner, so its lifetime belongs to the run, not to a component — the store (stores/chainSearch.ts)
 * creates a pool when a run starts and terminates it when the run stops. The request/response
 * bookkeeping below is otherwise the same pattern: `requestId`-tagged messages, a `pending` map, and
 * a worker-level `onerror` that rejects everything outstanding rather than leaving callers hanging.
 *
 * Every worker is initialised with the same `SearchInputs` once, then reused for every batch, so
 * each keeps its own prefix memo warm. See search/batch.ts for how a batch is split between them and
 * why the split is by prefix subtree rather than round-robin.
 *
 * THE WATCHDOG, AND THE HANG IT EXISTS FOR. `onerror` only fires for errors the worker's own thread
 * reports. It does NOT fire when a worker disappears — killed for memory, or taken down with a tab
 * the browser froze or discarded. That left the promise in `pending` unresolved AND unrejected, so
 * `Promise.all` over the batch never settled and the driver awaited a reply that was never coming.
 * Observed in the wild: a Thorough run sat at `7634 / ~8865 chains`, on the same progress line and
 * the same stale `~4h 31m left`, for eight and a half hours at 3% CPU. There was no error, no
 * timeout and no way to tell it apart from a slow batch. So every worker now heartbeats per chain
 * (see chainSearch.protocol.ts) and a request with no traffic for `STALL_MS` is failed loudly.

 * tab (Edge's sleeping tabs, or the machine sleeping), which suspends `setInterval` and the workers
 * alike. On resume the very first tick saw five hours of wall clock and killed a worker that had
 * merely been paused, before it could get a heartbeat out.
