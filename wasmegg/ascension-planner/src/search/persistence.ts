/**
 * Checkpointing a chain search to IndexedDB, so a refresh in hour two of a three-hour run does not

 *
 * Reuses lib/storage/db.ts's `metadata` store (the same partition-by-hashed-player-id scheme the
 * plan library and the active draft already use) rather than introducing a second storage layer.
 *
 * WHAT IS SAVED, AND WHY THAT IS ENOUGH TO RESUME. The expensive thing a run accumulates is the
 * chain -> duration cache: every entry in it is roughly fifteen seconds of CPU that never has to be
 * spent again. The driver itself is deterministic given that cache, so resuming does NOT need the
 * driver's internal loop position — restoring the cache and re-running from the top replays every
 * already-known chain as a cache hit (no simulation, no worker traffic) and then continues from
 * exactly where the run stopped. That is a fast replay, not a re-simulation, and it is far more
 * robust than serialising a half-finished nested loop.
 *
 * Per-leg summaries are kept ONLY for the current best chain. They exist to render the results
 * table; keeping them for every cached chain would multiply the record's size by roughly six for
 * information nothing reads.
