/**
 * Turning a finished run into something safe to share with other players.
 *
 * WHITELIST, NOT A SCRUBBER. The obvious design is "take the CSV and strip the identifying
 * bits", and it is the wrong one: a blacklist is only as good as the last thing someone
 * remembered to add to it, and it fails silently and invisibly when a new field appears
 * upstream. This builds a fresh object containing exactly the fields named below and nothing
 * else, so a field added to the CSV tomorrow cannot leak by default — it simply is not copied.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT IN HERE, and was never in the CSV either: the player id. `buildChainsCsv` has no
 * `playerId` in its metadata and never printed one, so "strip the EID" is already true by
 * construction. `scrubIdentifiers` exists anyway, for the one path where a player pastes a file
 * from somewhere else — belt and braces on a door that is already shut.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL IDENTIFYING, stated plainly because the consent has to be informed:
 *
 *   - The ARTIFACT INVENTORY is close to a fingerprint. Ten thousand items with exact counts
 *     is not anonymous among people who know each other. It is included because a chain's
 *     duration is meaningless without knowing what it was simulated with — a 740-day plan on a
 *     full T4L set is a different claim from the same plan on commons — so the trade is real and
 *     the UI says so before the button is pressed.
 *   - The TIMEZONE and the local plan start put the player in a region and a rough daily rhythm.
 *   - The AVAILABILITY WINDOW says when they are awake.
 *
 * The nickname is optional and free text; nothing is derived from the account.
