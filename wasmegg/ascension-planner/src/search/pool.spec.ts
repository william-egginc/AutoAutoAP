/**
 * The pool's watchdog.
 *
 * This exists because of a measured eight-and-a-half-hour hang: a worker died without firing an
 * error event, its promise stayed pending forever, `Promise.all` never settled, and the run sat on
 * `7634 / ~8865 chains` with a stale ETA at 3% CPU. There was nothing in the code that could ever
 * have noticed. These tests are the thing that notices.
 *
 * A fake worker rather than a real one: the real one imports the whole simulator, and the point
 * here is the bookkeeping, not the simulation.
