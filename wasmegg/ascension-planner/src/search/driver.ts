/**
 * The search itself — a port of the staged recipe in scripts/autoplan.py.
 *
 * READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING ANY OF IT. Every stage here exists because a simpler version of it was
 * measured losing time, and the comments record which:
 *
 *  - `resolveLast` re-solves the LAST checkpoint. It must not re-centre on the window edge: an
 *    earlier version returned the edge winner and recursed on it, so the window WALKED upward until
 *    it was sweeping 450-473 against a final of 490. The centre stays put; the window only widens,
 *    symmetrically, capped, and bounded above by `maxLast` (default final-150, because a tiny final
 *    leg pays a full rebuild for almost no earning time).
 *
 *  - `descent` re-solves the last checkpoint after EVERY accepted move. Moving any earlier
 *    checkpoint shifts every later arrival time, which shifts which weekly sale boundary the final
 *    build lands on. Skipping this cost 2.3 days on one measured test.
 *
 *  - `slices` exists because coordinate descent is not exact: on a measured case it ranked 4th of
 *    441 and lost 0.371 d to a joint (X2,X3) optimum no single-axis sweep can see. Its loop bound is
 *    `len - 2`, not `len - 3` — the older bound never swept the LAST adjacent pair, which is both
 *    the cheapest pair (longest shared prefix) and a pair `resolveLast` alone cannot move jointly.
 *
 *  - `countProbe` exists because the checkpoint COUNT is otherwise settled on a coarse grid and
 *    never revisited. Measured: a coarse scan ranked 7 checkpoints ahead of 6 by 2.675 d, and
 *    deleting one checkpoint from the polished 7-chain gave 195 219 248 286 327 490 — later
 *    confirmed rank 1 of a 4913-chain exhaustive. That one spurious checkpoint was the entire
 *    measured loss of that run.
 *
 * And one thing this file deliberately does NOT do: prune by prefix cost. A prefix that arrives
 * later can arrive with a higher delivery rate and win overall. Dropping candidates on early-leg
 * time is not safe.
 *
 * Everything is driven through `evaluateBatch`, so the driver knows nothing about workers. That is
 * what lets the same code be unit-tested against an inline evaluator.
