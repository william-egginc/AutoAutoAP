/**
 * Shared vocabulary for the in-browser chain search (src/search/*).
 *
 * A "chain" is the list of Truth-Egg checkpoints a player ascends through, ending at the final
 * target — `[195, 219, 248, 286, 327, 490]`. Every checkpoint is one ascension ("leg"); the number
 * the search reports is the wall-clock time from the plan start to the end of the last leg.
 *
 * The types here exist for one reason: `scripts/fastsearch.ts` reads all of its inputs out of Pinia
 * (`getSimulationContext()`, `createBaseEngineState(null)`, `useInitialStateStore()`), and a Web
 * Worker has no Pinia instance. So `SearchInputs` is the same information, resolved ONCE on the main
 * thread and shipped over `postMessage` — exactly the split researchCalc.worker.ts already uses, and
 * for the same reason (see its doc comment: the Pinia-bound helpers in engine/adapter.ts throw
 * immediately outside a Pinia context). Everything the simulation itself calls — `auto/ascension.ts`,
 * `auto/shifts/*`, `engine/compute.ts`, `lib/artifacts/*` — is already Pinia-free and safe to import
 * in a worker.
