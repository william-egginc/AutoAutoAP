/**
 * How a batch of chains is cut up across workers, and how many workers a batch is worth.
 *
 * BOTH of these are measurements, not preferences.
 *
 * SIZE THE POOL TO THE BATCH, NOT THE CPU. The CLI forks a process per shard for every batch, and
 * on a MacBook stage 2 (one 372-chain batch) ran at 1.43 s/chain while stage 4 (many 13-17 chain
 * batches) ran at 19.68 s/chain — a 13.8x small-batch penalty, versus 2.0x on the same work on
 * Windows. Spreading a 13-chain batch over 12 shards is mostly overhead.
 *
 * The browser is NOT identical to the CLI here and it is worth being precise about why, because the
 * naive translation would be wrong in the other direction. A Web Worker pool is created once and
 * kept, so worker STARTUP is paid once per run rather than once per batch — the CLI's dominant
 * small-batch cost mostly disappears. What does NOT disappear is the other half of the penalty:
 * splitting a batch destroys PREFIX SHARING. A 17-value sweep of the third checkpoint of a 6-leg
 * chain costs 2 + 17x4 = 70 leg simulations in one worker; spread over 17 workers it costs 17x6 =
 * 102, because every worker re-simulates the two shared leading legs. So the rule kept here is
 * "enough workers to use the machine, never so many that each one gets a single chain": a floor of
 * `MIN_CHAINS_PER_WORKER` chains each.
 *
 * CUT ON WHOLE PREFIX SUBTREES, NEVER ROUND-ROBIN OVER CHAINS. Same rule fastsearch.ts uses for its
 * process shards, for the same reason. The cut depth is the SHALLOWEST that yields at least as many
 * groups as there are workers: shallower means bigger subtrees and more sharing retained, but too
 * shallow cannot fill the pool.
 *
 * And one more measured caution against over-tuning: on Windows a 152-chain batch ran 668/624/673 s
 * at 6/12/17 shards — only 7.9% spread — and the PERFECTLY balanced 17-way split was the slowest of
 * the three. Balance is not the thing that matters; keeping subtrees intact is.
