/**
 * The run's whole chain -> duration cache, as a CSV — one row per LEG, not per chain.
 *
 * The panel's "show what it tried" log answers "what is the search doing"; this answers the
 * different question of "what did each candidate actually look like": which sale strategy each leg
 * used, when each leg started and ended in local time, what the peak delivery rate was, and which
 * milestones land in the middle of the night. Per-leg is the only granularity at which those
 * questions have answers, so a 4000-chain run becomes roughly 24000 rows — which is fine for a
 * spreadsheet and is the point.
 *
 * TWO HONEST GAPS, both visible in the output rather than hidden:
 *
 *   1. Per-leg detail exists only for chains still in memory. A checkpoint deliberately keeps
 *      `legs` for the BEST chain alone (see persistence.ts — keeping them all would multiply the
 *      record's size by about six for data nothing reads), so after a refresh-and-resume the
 *      replayed chains come back with their duration and nothing else. Those rows are emitted with
 *      the total filled in and the per-leg cells blank, because dropping them would silently
 *      under-report what the run priced.
 *
 *   2. Artifacts and stones are a property of the RUN, not of a candidate — the search never varies
 *      them, and the simulator re-optimises the equipped set inside each leg via `getOptimalELRSet`
 *      rather than being told what to wear. So they are recorded once in the header block, from the
 *      backup the run was launched against, and the header says which sets those are.
