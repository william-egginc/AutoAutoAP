/**
 * Message protocol shared between the chain-search worker pool (search/pool.ts) and
 * chainSearch.worker.ts.
 *
 * Same shape as researchCalc.protocol.ts — one request type per kind, `requestId`-tagged so a
 * response can be routed back to the caller still waiting on it — with one structural difference
 * worth calling out: this worker is STATEFUL. It is initialised once with `SearchInputs` (which
 * carries the player's backup, the single largest thing in any of these payloads) and then keeps
 * both those inputs and its own prefix memo across every subsequent `evaluate`. Re-sending the
 * inputs per batch would mean structured-cloning a multi-megabyte backup hundreds of times per run,
 * and re-creating the evaluator per batch would throw away the prefix memo that makes a
 * coordinate-descent sweep cheap in the first place (see search/chain.ts).
 *
 * The other difference is `progress`, and it exists because of an observed 8.5-hour hang. A batch
 * used to be a single silent request: one `postMessage` out, one reply back, nothing in between. So
 * a worker that died WITHOUT firing an error event — killed for memory, or taken down with a frozen
 * or discarded tab — left its promise pending forever, `Promise.all` never settled, and the driver
 * awaited a reply that was never coming. The UI went on showing the last progress line and a stale
 * ETA while nothing at all was computing. A per-chain heartbeat makes that state detectable (see
 * `STALL_MS` in search/pool.ts) and, as a side benefit, lets the counter move DURING a batch —
 * stage 6's widest sweep is a single ~2200-chain request that used to freeze the display for half
 * an hour at a time, which is exactly what made the real hang so hard to spot.
