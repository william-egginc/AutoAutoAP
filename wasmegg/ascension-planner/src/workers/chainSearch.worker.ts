/**
 * Web Worker entry point for the chain search: evaluates batches of Truth-Egg checkpoint chains
 * with the app's own simulator.
 *
 * The reason this is a worker at all is the same one researchCalc.worker.ts gives — one chain is
 * roughly fifteen seconds of straight-line CPU, and a whole run is hours, which the main thread
 * cannot absorb without Chrome's "Page Unresponsive" detector firing (that detector only watches the
 * main thread; a worker may peg its own for as long as it likes). The reason there are MANY of these
 * is different: the work is embarrassingly parallel over chains, and the CLI harness gets its speed
 * from `--jobs`.
 *
 * Thin dispatcher only, exactly like researchCalc.worker.ts: `init` builds a `ChainEvaluator` from
 * inputs the MAIN thread resolved out of Pinia, and `evaluate` runs chains through it. Do NOT import
 * `engine/adapter.ts`'s Pinia-bound helpers (`getSimulationContext`, the no-snapshot branch of
 * `createBaseEngineState`) here — they throw immediately outside a Pinia context, which a worker
 * never has. Everything under `auto/`, `engine/compute.ts`, `calculations/` and `lib/artifacts/` is
 * Pinia-free and safe; `stores/autoPlanner.ts` is imported only for its plain exported `pickVariant`
 * function, and a module-level `defineStore(...)` call needs no active Pinia instance.
 *
 * The evaluator is kept ALIVE between messages, holding the prefix memo. That is not an
 * optimisation detail — it is most of why a coordinate-descent sweep is affordable (see
 * search/chain.ts).
 *
 * Loaded via Vite's native worker support, no bundler config needed:
 *   new Worker(new URL('./chainSearch.worker.ts', import.meta.url), { type: 'module' })
