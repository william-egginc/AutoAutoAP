/**
 * Default the plan start to the moment the backup was taken, not to `now`.
 *
 * EXTRACTED FROM AutomaticPlanner SO INSANE MODE GETS IT TOO. It used to live inside that
 * component, which means it only ran when that component was mounted -- and Insane mode REPLACES
 * the Auto Planner rather than sitting beside it, so an exhaustive run never got the default at
 * all. Every number that panel prints is a date computed from the plan start, so the one mode
 * where the sync mattered most was the one mode that did not have it.
 *
 * The rule and the reasoning live in `lib/planStartTime.ts`, which is tested directly; this only
 * converts between its unix seconds and the date/time input strings the form holds.
 *
 * `startDefaulted` is MODULE-LEVEL, not per-caller. It expresses "this session has already taken a
 * default from a backup", and that has to stay true across a switch from one panel to the other --
 * per-instance state would re-apply the backup's time and silently overwrite a start the player
 * typed on the other panel a moment earlier.
 *
 * THE PROVISIONAL "NOW" AND WHY IT IS TRACKED. The first pass usually runs before the backup has
 * finished loading, and with no backup and an empty form `resolvePlanStart` answers `nowSeconds` --
 * a sensible placeholder on its own. But writing it into the form creates a start LATER than the
 * backup that arrives a second afterwards, and "a start after the backup" is a case
 * `resolvePlanStart` deliberately leaves alone, because asking to begin a plan tomorrow morning is
 * legitimate. So the placeholder blocked the very sync it was standing in for: measured on a fresh
 * page, the form read 09:45 today against a backup taken 21:21 the night before, and the plan was
 * timed from the page load rather than from the save.
 *
 * The fix is to remember the exact strings written as a placeholder. If the form still holds them
 * when a backup arrives, nobody has chosen anything and the backup wins. If it holds anything else,
 * the player typed a start and it is theirs -- which is the distinction `resolvePlanStart` cannot
 * make on its own, because by then both look like "a value that is later than the backup".
