<!--
  The Smart search explainer: what the problem is, what the players' runs have shown so far, and how
  the search attacks it. (The ask for runs lived here as "Help crack the formula"; it is the Science
  tab now, and this points there.)

  Updated 30 Sept 2026 from the Explorer's "What we know so far" card (29 Sept: 109 runs to 490 TE,
  13 accounts), the fact-checked source for every board number quoted here.

  The panel below this one asks for hours of the reader's own CPU on a run that can take all
  night, so the case for spending it has to be reachable without leaving the page. Everything here
  is prose and four static figures; nothing in this component touches the search or the simulator.

  ORDER IS THE ARGUMENT. Problem, then algorithm, then the request for data, because the request
  only makes sense once the reader knows that three accounts is what is holding the answer up.
  Section three sits in its own colour for the same reason: it is the only part that asks for
  something rather than explaining something.

  THE LONG TWO START CLOSED. They are reference material, and a repeat visitor wants the effort
  slider, not four figures between them and it. "Help crack the formula" stays open because nobody
  opens a section with that title unprompted.

  Figures come from `lib/charts/chainSearchMath.ts`, which holds exhaustive-sweep output as
  literals. Any number quoted in the prose next to a figure is interpolated from that module
  wherever it reasonably can be, so re-running a sweep and pasting new data cannot leave a sentence
  asserting the old result. The few that are still typed out (4913 grid points, the 37.4-day
  maxLast figure, 8.6 and 12.0 days) come from runs whose raw output is not in this repo, and are
  documented in FOR_MATH_NERDS.md instead.

          You reach a Truth Egg target by ascending to a checkpoint, prestiging, ascending to a higher one, and so on.
          That list of checkpoints is a chain:
          <code class="font-mono-premium text-slate-800">195 219 248 286 327 490</code>. You pick them and the game does
          the rest. The plans players have sent in run two to three years, and two chains to the same target can finish
          <span class="font-bold text-slate-800">weeks apart</span>: moving one checkpoint by a single TE, with the rest

              Guessing a chain's duration without simulating it. A feature-based predictor scored Spearman ρ = −0.053
              against the truth, a median error of 15.6 days, and zero overlap with the true top 100. It is
              anti-correlated, so it is worse than having nothing. Unmodelled farm state shifts a single leg by 1 to 2.6
              days while the whole top 100 spans under two, so the noise is larger than the signal.
            </li>
            <li>
              Discarding chains that start slowly. A prefix that arrives later can arrive with a higher delivery rate
              and win overall, so early-leg time is not a safe basis for pruning. An implemented branch-and-bound cut 0
              of 69 chains on a real run.

            Every tooth is one missed sale. The best value in a sweep always sat at a

            That run length is what makes a narrow sweep viable. The function is piecewise and the pieces are a few

            run plus the boundary that ends it. Replaying the search across 4913 exhaustive grid points put the knee at

            reachable from there. The same {{ SEED_SENSITIVITY.cells.toLocaleString() }}-chain box was priced under

            What you get out of this is a strong local optimum. It has never been proven to be the global one, and the
            search cannot tell you how far off it is. The effort tiers' accuracy figures still come from three accounts,
            only one of which has a proven optimum to check against (the board has 13 accounts, but few ran the same
            space both ways). That is also why there are no confidence percentages here: three observations cannot
            honestly be turned into a probability.
